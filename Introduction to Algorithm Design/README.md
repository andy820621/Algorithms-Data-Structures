### Linear Search (Sequential Search)

- It’s an algorithm that sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.
- Probably the easily algorithm we will learn in this course.
- Performance:

  - Worst Case Performance: O(n)
  - Best Case Performance: O(1)
  - Average performance O(𝑛/2)

### Binary Search

- Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
- More efficient than linear search, but only works with sorted data set.
- Performance:

  - Worst Case Performance: O(log⁡𝑛)
  - Best Case Performance: O(1)
  - Average performance O(log⁡𝑛)
