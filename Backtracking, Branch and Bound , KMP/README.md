# Backtracking & Branch and Bound & KMP

## Backtracking

- Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and **abandons** a candidate (**backtracks**) as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
- Backtracking is considered as one of the BRUTE FORCE solutions.
- Backtracking is often much faster than brute force enumeration of all complete candidates, since it can eliminate many candidates with a single test.

### 8 Queens Puzzle

- The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
- In general, we want to know how many solutions are there in a N Queens puzzle.

## Branch and Bound Algorithm

- Branch and bound is an algorithm design paradigm which is generally used for solving **combinatorial optimization** problems. These problems are typically **exponential** in terms of time complexity $(n\ items => 2^n)$ and may require exploring all possible permutations in worst case. The Branch and Bound Algorithm technique solves these problems relatively quickly.
- Before enumerating the candidate solutions of a branch, the branch is checked against upper or lower estimated bounds on the optimal solution, and is discarded if it cannot produce a better solution than the best one found so far by the algorithm.

> $*$ If a problem can be solved by BRUTE FORCE with backtracking, then the optimization solution can be found by branch and bound.

### 0/1 Knapsack Problem

- 0/1 Knapsack problem means finding the maximum profit choice of items with the condition that we either take an item into our bag or not.
- Potential Solutions are:
  1. Brute Force
  2. Backtracking (Optimize the Brute Force Solution)
  3. Branch and Bound
