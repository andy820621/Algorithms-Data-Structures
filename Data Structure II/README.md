# Data Structure II

## Graph (Definition)

- In computer science, a graph is an **abstract data type**.
- A graph data structure consists of a finite set of **vertices** (also called **nodes** or **points**.)
- Lines between nodes are known as **edges** (also called **links** or **lines**), and for **a directed graph** are also known as **arrows**.

- **In a directed graph** direction matters. i.e. edge V2->V3 means that edge is directed. There is only an edge from V2 to V3 and no edge from V3 to V2. Therefore you can go from vertex V2 to vertex V3 but not from V3 to V2.

- **In undirected graph** V2-V3 means the edge has no direction, i.e. V2-V3 means you can go both from V2 to V3 and V3 to V2.

## Tree (Definition)

- Tree is a graph without a loop.
- Tree must have one and only one root

### Tree Traversal

- Since tree is a commonly used data structure, we need a systematic way to know what nodes are in a tree.
- There are two ways to do tree traversal:
  1. Breadth-First Tree Traversal (See the [Code](Traversal%20Methods/Breadth-First.js))
  2. Depth-First Tree Traversal
     - PreOrder (See the [Code](Traversal%20Methods/PreOrder.js))
     - InOrder (See the [Code](Traversal%20Methods/InOrder.js))
     - PostOrder (See the [Code](Traversal%20Methods/PostOrder.js))

Use above methods to traverse this tree expect to get the results:

```javascript
// BFTT
breadthFirst(rootNode); // expect to get the result: [10, 9, 7, 8, 5, 11, 1, 3, 6, 4, 2]

// PreOrder
preOrder(rootNode); // expect to get the result: [10, 9, 8, 6, 5, 11, 7, 1, 4, 2, 3]

// InOrder
inOrder(rootNode); // expect to get the result: [6, 8, 9, 5, 11, 10, 4, 1, 2, 7, 3]

// PostOrder
postOrder(rootNode); // expect to get the result: [6, 8, 5, 11, 9, 4, 2, 1, 3, 7, 10]
```

### Binary Search Tree (BST)

- **Binary Tree** means each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.
- **Binary Search Tree** is a binary tree, but the left child is always less than the root, and the right child is always greater than the root.
- See the [Code](Binary-Search-Tree.js)

> **Performance of Binary Search Tree**

> Worst Case Performance: $O(n)$
> Best Case Performance: $O(1)$
> Average Case Performance: $O(log$ $n)$
