# Sorting Algorithms

- Sorting is one of the most fundamental of all algorithms in Computer Science.
- Even though many modern programming languages have built-in sorting functions, it’s still a good thing to know how it works.
- We are going to learn 6 different sorting algorithms in this course. It’s good to know when to use which algorithm, as they excel in some certain cases.

### List of Algorithms

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort

## Bubble Sort

- Bubble sort compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- This simple algorithm performs poorly in real world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.

  > Worst Case Performance: O(𝑛^2)  
  > Best Case Performance: O(𝑛)  
  > Average performance O(𝑛^2)

## Insertion Sort

- Insertion sort is a little bit more efficient than bubble sort in practice. Theoretically, they have the same Big O value.
- The principle of insertion sort is simple. Keeping inserting a new value into a sorted array. Insert it to the correct spot so the sorted array remains sorted.
