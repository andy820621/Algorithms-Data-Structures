### Linear Search (Sequential Search)

- Itâ€™s an algorithm that sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.
- Probably the easily algorithm we will learn in this course.

- In our coding practice, we will try to find a number inside an array. If the number could be found, then return the index. If not, then return -1.

### Binary Search

- Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
- More efficient than linear search, but only works with sorted data set.
